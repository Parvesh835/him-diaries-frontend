            Kinnaur district is a mountainous district located in the northeast
            part of the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. Kinnaur district
            borders Tibet to the east, the state of Uttarakhand to the south,
            Shimla district to the southwest, Kullu district to the west, and
            Lahaul and Spiti district to the north.

            <br />
            <br />
            Over the 10th-11th centuries A.D., Kinnaur was a part of the Guge
            kingdom. The Guge kingdom broke apart in the 12th century, and the
            Bushahr state arose in the Western Himalayas, taking over most parts
            of present-day Kinnaur. The Bushahr state originated in the Kamru
            village of Sangla valley. However, the uppermost part of Kinnaur
            remained under Tibetan influence until the late 17th century, when
            it was handed over to the Bushahr state by the Tibetans as a reward
            for assistance in the Tibet-Ladakh-Mughal War. The Bushahr state
            shifted its capital to Sarahan, and later still to Rampur, which
            caused this state to be known eventually as 'Rampur-Bushahr'.
            Rampur-Bushahr was attacked by the Gurkhas in the early 19th
            century. Soon afterwards, the British gained supremacy in the
            region. Rampur-Bushahr became a princely state owing suzerainty to
            the British crown, until India's Independence in 1947. Most of
            present-day Kinnaur district was known as 'Chini tehsil' under the
            Rampur-Bushahr state. On 15 April, 1948, Rampur-Bushahr became a
            part of the Republic of India, and a part of an administrative unit
            called the Mahasu district. In 1960, the Chini tehsil and fourteen
            villages of the neighbouring Rampur tehsil were separated from the
            Mahasu district to create the new district of Kinnaur.

            <br />
            <br />
            Kinnaur is an entirely mountainous district. The general altitude
            range is 1,500 metres above sea level to over 6,000 metres above sea
            level. The district is drained by several tributaries of the Sutlej
            River. Three mountain ranges run through or touch Kinnaur: the
            Zanskar Range, the Great Himalaya Range, and the Dhauladhar Range.
            The highest peak of Kinnaur district, Leo Purgyil (6,816m), is also
            the highest peak of Himachal Pradesh state. The Kinner Kailash peak
            (6,050m), a regional pilgrimage site for Hindus, is also located in
            Kinnaur. Administratively, Kinnaur is the third largest district by
            size in Himachal Pradesh, with an area of 6,401 sq. km. The district
            has five tehsils (Nichar, Kapla, Sangla, Pooh, and Moorang) and one
            sub-tehsil (Hangrang). For development purposes, the district is
            divided into three developmental blocks—Nichar, Kalpa, and Pooh.
